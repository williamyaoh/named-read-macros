(in-package #:named-read-macros-test)

;; Trying to test this package is a little bit weird, since there's the
;; possibility of errors at _read_ time, which means they'll happen before
;; our testing framework actually sees them. Instead, we'll read from a file,
;; so that our read-time errors happen at run-time.

;; Each file in the subdirectory `test-cases/` should be a text file, containing
;; two Lisp forms. The second of these is a form using a named read macro, which
;; is what we're testing.

;; The _first_ is a form which should evaluate to another form, which is then
;; compared EQUAL against the results of READing the named read macro.
